# GreenVisionFoundation
A tree planting competition websystem to encourage tree planting in, which sought to propose a 
solution that reduces or reverses gas emissions and footprints. The solution works in such a way 
that once a user has planted a tree and photographs it, the website allows the user to register and 
upload the image.  Computer Vision recognizes the uploaded image and confirms that the 
object in the image is a tree. If validation is successful, the database is updated with the user’s 
name, location, and tree image URL. If the user uploads another image and it is validated, the 
user’s tree count in the database grows. If the validation fails, the user is prompted to upload a 
new image. After a month, the user with the most trees planted receives an award. The website 
also includes an education page where users can learn about the importance of planting trees, the 
consequences of cutting down trees, and how to plant a tree
